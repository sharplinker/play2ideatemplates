Play Framework 2 IDEA live templates and file templates

## Tips

Follow these instructions to install the file(s) in templates: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/live-templates.html

Put the file(s) in fileTemplates in the fileTemplates directory located in the same directory where you've found the templates directory from the previous step.

IntelliJ syncs its in-memory fileTemplates to disk when it quits, and you need to re-launch IntelliJ for the new fileTemplates to become available. Thus, you must quit IntelliJ first, then copy (or symlink) the fileTemplate(s) to the correct directory, and only then re-launch IntelliJ. If you put the file in place, and then quit and re-launch IntelliJ, the new file will be deleted.

Cheers!
